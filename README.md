# ai-game-minimax-project
Implementation of a Tic-Tac-Toe game with a predictive AI opponent using the Minimax algorithm. The project demonstrates decision-making in adversarial environments, where the AI evaluates possible game states to choose optimal moves. The game is implemented in Python, with a graphical user interface built using Tkinter.
